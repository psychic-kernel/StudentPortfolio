It will also behave as an interactive calendar where you can accomplish usual tasks you would expect from a calendar app, but with the aim to not have the kind of clutter that many apps including apples calendar. It's a tricky task, if you'd want to accomplish just the basic functioning calender:
* Schedule events and display on a not so cluttered UI
* Quickly and with little stress, add people from your contact list to the event. 
* The ability to send text messages to the group for synchronous communication across a large number of people. 
## General Sense of the the application:
* The aim is to provide a more direct means of communication within active organizations, groups. A sense of togetherness and not a question in ones mind as to whether you're being ghosted or not. Given this sense the application can more optimally stream line quality future planning, optimization of the planned events in themselves.
